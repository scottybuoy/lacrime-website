                    For Lacrimé serum, our research and development team found the <a className='link' href='https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6201288/' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">study from the University of Pittsburgh</a> named the “Neurobiology of Human Crying” fascinating. Conducted by Lauren Bylsma, an assistant professor of psychiatry who studies human crying, this research found that crying, particularly emotional crying, serves as a crucial mechanism for social communication and emotional regulation, particularly in the juvenile period of life. Tears act as a signal.
                    Despite the ubiquity of this human behavior, research is only just beginning to uncover the neurobiological underpinnings of human emotional crying. Their team studied neuroanatomical, neurochemical, and psychophysiological findings, given how the primary sources of information are currently from animal studies and observations in neurological patients suffering from pathological crying.
